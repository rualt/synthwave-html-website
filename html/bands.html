                Franck Hueso, better known by his stage name Carpenter Brut,
                is a French synthwave artist from Poitiers. Little personal
                information is known about him aside from his French origin. His anonymity
                is a deliberate artistic choice in order to place more importance on the music
                itself rather than the identity of the musician behind it.
