            (also spelled Soviet wave or Soviet-wave)

            of post-Soviet states, primarily Russia. It is characterized

        <h3>Darksynth</h3>
        <p class="description">
            Synthwave artists began to fully incorporate atmospheric
             Horror Synth with a heavier style. Led by Perturbator,
              Carpenter Brut, and Mega Drive in 2012, this new style of music
               incorporated bass heavy electro and industrial music, faster tempos,
                embraced ultra-violent video games and action movies, and gained massive
                 success within the fandom.

        <h3>Chillwave</h3>
        <p class="description">
            is a music microgenre that emerged in the late 2000s.
             It is characterized by a faded or dreamy retro pop sound,
              escapist lyrics (frequent topics include the beach or summer),
               psychedelic or lo-fi aesthetics, mellow vocals, low-to-moderate tempos,
                effects processing (especially reverb), and vintage synthesizers. The term
                 was originally synonymous with "glo-fi" or "hypnagogic pop".
