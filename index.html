                <strong>Synthwave</strong> (also called <em>outrun</em>, <em>retrowave</em>, or <em>futuresynth</em>)
                is a genre of electronic music and an internet phenomenon
                influenced by 1980s film soundtracks and video games.
            </p>
                In its music and cover artwork, synthwave
                engages in retrofuturism, emulating 1980s science fiction, action,
                and horror media, sometimes compared to cyberpunk.
            <p>
                It expresses nostalgia for 1980s culture,
                attempting to capture the era's atmosphere and celebrate it.

                Beginning in the mid 2000s, the genre developed from various niche communities on the Internet,
                 reaching wider popularity in the early 2010s.

                Synthwave was inspired
                 by many 1980s films, video games, and cartoons.
                  as well as composers such as John Carpenter, Vangelis,
                   and Tangerine Dream. However the genre itself
                    arose from electronic dance music genres including house,
                     synth, and nu-disco.
            </p>
            <p>
                The subgenre name "outrun" comes from the 1986
                 driving arcade game Out Run, which was known for
                  its soundtrack that could be selected in-game.
