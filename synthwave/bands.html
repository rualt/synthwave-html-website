                <b>Franck Hueso</b>, better known by his stage name Carpenter Brut,
                is a French synthwave artist from Poitiers. Little personal
                information is known about him aside from his French origin. His anonymity
                is a deliberate artistic choice in order to place more importance on the music
                itself rather than the identity of the musician behind it.

                 They are musicians coming from different metal bands.
                 That metal background is very apparent in their music,
                  which is a vibrant blend of metal and synths inspired by
                   80's <i>John Carpenter</i> horror.

                James Kent (born 1993), known by his stage name Perturbator,
                is a French synthwave musician from Paris.
                Kent has a background as a guitarist in several black metal bands.

                and with inspiration from movies such as Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and the Running Man. 
                He uses a variety of software synths in his productions, such as the emulators of old vintage synths
                 like the OB-X or the CS-80.
